<h1>Who are the Kava Kings?</h1>
    <p><strong>Kava Kings, Ltd.</strong> are purveyors of the finest gourmet root and instant 
    kava from throughout the Pacific region. Break your coffee and alcohol 
    habit and try a natural “anti-caffeine” drink.</p>


<p /><h1>VIBE INSTANT KAVA</h1>
<p />New to Kava? This is our <em>most user-friendly</em> kava drink. Just stir this <em>instant</em> Kava into 
water, juice, or your favorite beverage and it dissolves instantly.  
No need to use a strainer bag with this product!
<p />Experience the comfort of kava with minimum effort! This product is a 
highly concentrated water extract of fresh kava root juice that is then 
dehydrated.  Since it is not ground, it does not contain the fibrous 
root material and therefor does not need to be strained. Made in Vanuatu 
using absolutely no chemical solvents, just kava and rain water. This is 
just about as close as you can get to drinking kava in a Vanuatu Nakamal 
(kava bar). 
<p />Vibe Instant is <em>twice as potent</em> as dried root powder. Serving for (1) person is approximately 5 grams.
