                        <h1>What is Kava?</h1>
                        <p><strong>Kava 卡瓦胡椒</strong> <em>(Piper methysticum)</em> is consumed for medicinal, religious, 
                        political, cultural and social purposes throughout the islands of the 
                        South Pacific. 
                        <br />
                        A shrub that thrives in loose, well-drained soils where 
                        plenty of air can reach the roots, kava plants are typically harvested 
                        at 3-4 years of age. Pacific Islanders have consumed kava root tea for 
                        over 3,000 years. We invite you to experience the tradition for yourself.
                        <br />
                        As time has progressed so have the techniques used to make this sacred 
                        island drink. We want you to be able to experience the best kava 
                        available. At Kava Kings we strive to make the highest quality kava 
                        available to the kava community and consumers all over the world.

                                    Experience the comfort of kava with minimum effort! This product is a 
                                    highly concentrated water extract of fresh kava root juice that is then 
                                    dehydrated.  Since it is not ground, it does not contain the fibrous 
                                    root material and therefor does not need to be strained.
