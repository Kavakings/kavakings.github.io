<h2>What is Kava?</h2>
<p /><strong>Kava 卡瓦胡椒</strong> <em>(Piper methysticum)</em> is consumed for medicinal, religious, 
political, cultural and social purposes throughout the islands of the 
South Pacific. A shrub that thrives in loose, well-drained soils where 
plenty of air can reach the roots, kava plants are typically harvested 
at 3-4 years of age. Pacific Islanders have consumed kava root tea for 
over 3,000 years. We invite you to experience the tradition for yourself.
As time has progressed so have the techniques used to make this sacred 
island drink. We want you to be able to experience the best kava 
available. At Kava Kings we strive to make the highest quality kava 
available to the kava community and consumers all over the world.
